These are templates and examples scripts to inject some batch code in Windows with a "Digispark ATTINY85" bad usb.
What I mean by injecting some code is making it possible to run some preprogrammed batch code after removing the bad usb.

Note :
- The slow version is more stable than the fast one
- Only for french azerty keyboards

Info :
- The rickroll scripts consist of rickrolling the victim 15 minutes after the script injection
- Files created by these scripts are located in `%TEMP%` and are deleted after their usage

Todo :
- Make it compatible with English keyboards and maybe more languages
